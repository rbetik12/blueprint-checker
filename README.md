# Blueprint checker

Unreal Engine-based utility, that parses uassets with local user engine infrastructure and outputs data stored in it.

## How it works

User can launch program in 3 modes:

- Single file mode (process single uasset file)
- Batch mode (parses list of uasset paths and process them)
- StdIn mode (works as a daemon that waits path to uassets from stdin)

Command line arguments
```
OPTION       REQUIRED   DESCRIPTION
===========================================
-h, --help      no      Help
-t, --test      no      Run all tests
-m=, --mode=    no      Utility launch mode [Single|Batch|StdIn]
-f=, --filepath=        no      Path to a file.
In single mode - blueprint path.
In batch mode - filenames file path
In StdIn mode - Launch in daemon-like mode
```

Currently utility outputs content of export map in JSON format to standard output.
All information is gathered from Unreal Engine class `FLinkerLoad` it contains all needed information about uasset object.

## Tested on
- Windows 10 (MSVC version 19.28.29336)
- Unreal Engine built from sources of 4.26.2-release branch

## Known issues
- Some assets doesn't load fully (using `LoadObject<T>()` method), but probably `FLinkerLoad` still can be filled

## How to build
1. Clone the repo like this `<Unreal Engine root directory>/Engine/Programs/Source`
2. Run GenerateProgramFiles.bat to generate project file
3. Open your favorite IDE and add BlueprintChecker project from `<Unreal Engine root directory>/Engine/Intermediate/ProjectFiles`
4. Build and run
